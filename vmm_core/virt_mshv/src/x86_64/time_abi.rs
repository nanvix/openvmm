//! The NVX time ABI on MSHV.
//!
//! A partition built with a [`TimeAbiConfig`] shows the guest the time ABI's
//! minimal Hyper-V identity, served by OpenVMM rather than by the hypervisor:
//!
//! - The partition has no synthetic processor features, so the hypervisor
//!   reports no hypervisor CPUID leaves and serves no synthetic MSR itself.
//!   With them, it would serve `HV_X64_MSR_VP_INDEX` and the frequency MSRs
//!   natively and never deliver their intercepts, and
//!   `HV_X64_MSR_TSC_FREQUENCY` would report this host's rate instead of the
//!   declared one.
//! - MSR-index intercepts route reads of the four identity MSRs and writes of
//!   `HV_X64_MSR_TSC_INVARIANT_CONTROL` to [`TimeAbiMsrs`]. The hypervisor
//!   raises #GP itself for writes to the three read-only identity MSRs, even
//!   when they are intercepted, and for every other MSR of the identity range.
//! - CPUID intercept results present the configured CPUID verbatim: it is the
//!   CPU profile's complete effective CPUID, and the backend adds nothing to
//!   it. The extended topology leaves are registered once per VP with that
//!   VP's x2APIC ID, which the hypervisor does not provide for these
//!   partitions. Entries the effective CPUID does not list show the
//!   hypervisor's own guest view, which reads zero there: the CPUID sweep
//!   hardware test checks it, and verification (`E_CPU_UNLISTED`) checks the
//!   ones the host enumerates at every boot and restore. The hypervisor
//!   reports no hypervisor leaf of its own, which preflight verifies at
//!   sentinel leaves.
//! - The processor feature banks follow the CPU profile (see
//!   [`profile_features`](super::profile_features)), keep the invariant TSC,
//!   and hide the TSC-deadline timer, `IA32_TSC_ADJUST`, and APERF/MPERF.
//! - The synchronized TSC set freezes partition time, writes the target to
//!   every created VP, reads it back, and resumes partition time right after a
//!   good read-back. Guest time therefore runs from the restore anchor, as on
//!   the other backends, instead of waiting for the first VP run.
//!
//! These semantics were verified on hypervisor builds 10.0.26100.30000 (bare
//! metal) and 10.0.26100.9444 (Azure nested), where they are identical.
