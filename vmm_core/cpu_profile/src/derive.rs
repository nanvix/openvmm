//! Deriving a CPU profile from host fingerprints.
//!
//! A profile serves one CPU generation on every backend, so it is the
//! intersection of what every backend supports on every fingerprinted host
//! of the generation, under a fixed policy:
//!
//! 1. Within each backend, and then across backends, each CPUID register is
//!    combined by its class: feature flags by intersection, numeric limits
//!    by minimum, and descriptive values (signature, cache, TLB) by majority,
//!    one vote per host within a backend and one per backend across them. A
//!    tie is an error.
//! 2. Only the leaves of [`DATA_LEAVES`] keep data, and in AMD profiles also
//!    those of [`AMD_DATA_LEAVES`], AMD's cache, topology, and speculation
//!    leaves; every other leaf in range is zero. The time ABI's CPU time bits
//!    are applied, and features a VM must not see (virtualization, power
//!    management, performance monitoring, debug, SGX, RDT, PT, CET, key
//!    locker) are cleared, in AMD profiles also where AMD enumerates them
//!    (SVM, IBS, LWP, the performance counter extensions, MONITORX, RDPRU,
//!    PPIN, CPPC, and the like). AMD's speculation controls and immunities
//!    stay, those of `0x80000021` included, but for what KVM cannot present:
//!    `BTC_NO` goes, and PSFD stays only beside a `SPEC_CTRL` control
//!    ([`has_spec_ctrl_control`]). Intel's enumerations of its speculation
//!    controls and `IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES`, which KVM adds on AMD hosts
//!    ([`INTEL_SPECULATION_ENUMERATIONS`]), go too.
//! 3. The XSAVE features are the intersection, within [`ALLOWED_XCR0`], and
//!    the XSAVE leaf is rebuilt from them; every host must agree on the
//!    layout. A feature whose XSAVE state is not enabled is cleared.
//! 4. The brand string is generic per generation, such as
//!    `Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processor (<display name>)`,
//!    `Intel(R) Core(TM) Processor (<display name>)`, or
//!    `AMD EPYC Processor (<display name>)`, without a frequency
//!    ([`KnownGeneration::brand`]), so every host of a generation presents
//!    it whatever its SKU, and the hosts' brands are not compared.
//! 5. `IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES` is pinned in [`ARCH_CAPABILITIES_PINNED_MASK`]
//!    to what every backend can present: KVM's value, and for MSHV and WHP
//!    the bits their processor feature banks derive. `ITS_NO` is pinned
//!    clear because the Hyper-V backends cannot present it.
//! 6. The bits OpenVMM sets per VM ([`vm_owned_bits`](crate::vm_owned_bits))
//!    are zero and unmasked.
//!
//! The AMD rules apply only to AMD profiles, so the policy derives every
//! Intel profile as it did before AMD profiles existed.
//!
//! [`derive_host_profile`] applies the same policy to one fingerprint of the
//! host that OpenVMM runs on, for `--cpu-profile host`: a development profile
//! that serves only that host's CPU model and stepping, and that no catalog
//! pins.
