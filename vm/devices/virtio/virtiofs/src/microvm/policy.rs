//! The path-scoped access policy of a microVM share.
//!
//! A share's policy consists of three sets of canonical share-relative paths:
//!
//! - A *denied* path hides itself and everything below it from the guest.
//! - An *allowed* path exposes itself and everything below it again, inside a
//!   denied path.
//! - When a read-write share has *writable* paths, they are the only parts of
//!   the share that the guest can modify, and the rest of the share is
//!   read-only.
//!
//! The nearest denied or allowed path that contains a path decides whether the
//! guest can see it. The nearest one that contains a denied path must be an
//! allowed path, if any, and the nearest one that contains an allowed path
//! must be a denied path, so no path in the policy is redundant.
//!
//! A hidden directory that leads to an allowed path is *traverse-only*: the
//! guest can look it up and list the entries that lead to allowed paths, but
//! it can see nothing else in it, and it can modify neither the directory nor
//! its entries.
//!
//! The share's root may itself be a denied path, the empty path, when allowed
//! paths expose parts of it again. The root is then traverse-only, so the
//! guest sees only the allowed paths, and the ways to them.
