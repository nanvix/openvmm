# virtio-fs

OpenVMM can expose a host directory to a Linux guest through `virtio-fs`.

## Standard machine

For the standard machine, `--virtio-fs` creates a HostFs device with a
caller-selected tag and host path:

```bash
openvmm --virtio-fs myfs,path/to/share
```

Mount it in the guest with the same tag:

```bash
mount -t virtiofs myfs /mnt/share
```

Standard-machine virtio-fs may use the normal PCI, VPCI, or MMIO placement
rules. It does not support snapshot and restore.

## microVM

The microVM profile reserves one fixed virtio-fs slot. Without `--mount`, the
slot is guest-discoverable but dormant and has no HostFs backend or filesystem
policy. Configure an active attachment with:

```bash
openvmm --machine microvm \
  --mount /mnt/share,path/to/share,ro \
  --mount-deny path/to/share/secrets \
  --kernel path/to/vmlinux --initrd path/to/initramfs.cpio.gz
```

The format is `GUEST_TARGET,HOST_PATH[,ro|rw]`. The default mode is `ro`;
read-write access must be explicit. The profile fixes the remaining
guest-visible configuration:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Stable ID | `fs:microvm0` |
| Tag | `microvm` |
| Transport | virtio-mmio at `0xd0001000` |
| Interrupt | IRQ 6 |
| Queues | One high-priority and one request queue |
| Features | Indirect descriptors, event index, version 1, access-platform |
| DAX window | None |
| Cache policy | Zero entry and attribute lifetimes |
| File policy | Direct I/O |
| Maximum write | 1 MiB payload plus protocol headers |
| Symbolic links | `rw`: created with the exact target; `ro`: `EROFS` |
| Host identity | `--mount-owner vmm` (default) or `caller` (Linux only) |

For an active cold-boot attachment, the profile adds `virtfs_dir`,
`virtfs_tag`, and `virtfs_mode` bootstrap tokens to the kernel command line.
The fixed transport is always discoverable. Active attachment policy and the
canonical absolute host path become snapshot-authoritative.
Repeat `--mount-deny` to hide existing host files or directories. OpenVMM
canonicalizes each entry relative to the export and rejects paths outside the
root, the root itself, overlapping entries, symlink/reparse components, and
nested-mount crossings before opening the device.

A read-write attachment lets the guest create symbolic links, so ordinary
build tools (package managers, virtual environments, and language
toolchains) work in a live share. HostFs stores each target byte for byte and
never follows a link while resolving a host path; the guest kernel resolves
links in its own namespace. A target that names an absolute host path, a
location above the export, or a denied path therefore cannot reach host data
outside the policy. Opening a link object fails with `ELOOP`, and on Linux
changing its mode fails with `EOPNOTSUPP`. On Windows, HostFs always creates
WSL-style links, which Windows path resolution never follows, so Windows tools
see guest-created links as inaccessible files. Host software that later reads
the exported directory must treat guest-created links as untrusted.

`SectionFs`, aggregate roots, alternate tags, PCI transport, DAX, and extra
queues are not part of the microVM profile.

### Host identity

By default, HostFs performs every guest operation as the OpenVMM process, so
files that the guest creates belong to the OpenVMM user, and host permission
checks use that user's privileges. `--mount-owner caller` instead performs
each guest request as the guest caller:

```bash
sudo openvmm --machine microvm \
  --mount /workspace,path/to/workspace,rw \
  --mount-owner caller \
  --kernel path/to/vmlinux --initrd path/to/initramfs.cpio.gz
```

- For each request, the request thread switches its filesystem UID and GID to
  the UID and GID that the guest kernel reports for the calling process,
  clears its supplementary groups, and clears its effective capabilities. The
  host kernel therefore checks the operation exactly as it would for an
  unprivileged process with that identity, and new files belong to it.
  Supplementary groups of the guest caller are not forwarded.
- Requests from guest UID 0 or GID 0 are squashed, independently, to the owner
  of the export root. The export root must belong to a non-root user and group;
  OpenVMM rejects a root-owned export before boot. The guest can therefore
  never create root-owned files, give files to root, create device nodes,
  or set file capabilities on the host.
- The OpenVMM process needs `CAP_SETUID` and `CAP_SETGID`, for example by
  running as root or through file capabilities
  (`setcap cap_setuid,cap_setgid=ep openvmm`). If a request cannot switch to
  the caller identity, including when these capabilities are missing, it fails
  with `EPERM`; it never falls back to the OpenVMM identity. Releasing handles
  and unmounting do not access host objects and always succeed.
- Only Linux hosts support caller identity. On Windows, OpenVMM rejects
  `--mount-owner caller` before boot, because a Windows process cannot act as
  an arbitrary POSIX UID and GID.

The guest kernel selects the caller identity. A guest that can change its own
UID or GID can therefore act as any non-root host identity within the export;
root squash only prevents it from acting as root. Snapshot capture and restore
revalidate saved objects as the OpenVMM process, which must be able to reach
every object that the guest holds open.

## Snapshot attachments

A microVM snapshot stores FUSE negotiation, namespace identifiers, lookup
counts, reopenable handles, directory cookies, and virtqueue progress. It
does not copy the host directory or serialize native file descriptors and
Windows handles.

An open directory continues from its bounded captured entry snapshot, so
later host additions do not appear midway through that enumeration. New
lookups and newly opened directories still observe the live host tree.

Restoring a snapshot captured with an active attachment requires a fresh
`--mount` argument and the exact same denied-path set, canonical host path,
guest target, mode, and `--mount-owner` policy. Identity validation remains independent: before any vCPU starts,
OpenVMM pins the supplied root and validates its saved root and object
identities. Missing, moved, replaced, ambiguous, or no-longer-reopenable
objects fail restore. A saved symbolic link is revalidated as the link itself,
without being followed, and an alias whose ancestor has become a link fails
restore.

A snapshot captured without `--mount` records the fixed slot as dormant. It
may restore without an attachment, or bind a new `--mount` attachment. Because
execution resumes after the cold-boot mount hook, the guest must mount the
newly attached backend explicitly:

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/share
mount -t virtiofs microvm /mnt/share
```

Snapshots created before the dormant-slot capability cannot add a restore-time
attachment and fail with a compatibility error.

```admonish warning
An ordinary host directory is live external state. Host changes after capture
can be visible after restore or make identity validation fail. Restoring the
same read-write VM snapshot does not roll the host directory back.
Quiesce external host writers when deterministic replay is required.
```

The snapshot contract uses the `live-revalidate` policy. Immutable filesystem
generations and private writable clones are not currently exposed.

Snapshot destinations, restore directories, and explicit guest-memory backing
files must be outside the exported host tree. OpenVMM rejects configurations
that would expose guest RAM or snapshot files through virtio-fs.

## Security model

Guest FUSE requests, paths, and saved aliases are untrusted. HostFs rejects
absolute and parent-relative aliases, does not follow symbolic links or
Windows reparse points while resolving guest or saved objects, and enforces
read-only mode before invoking a host mutation. With `--mount-owner caller`,
HostFs also performs each request with the squashed caller identity and no
capabilities, as described in [Host identity](#host-identity).

On Linux, every host operation opens the parent directory of its path with
`openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS)`, or with one
`O_NOFOLLOW` open per component where `openat2` is unavailable, and applies
the operation to the final component without following it. Extended
attributes and file system statistics use that pinned directory rather than
an absolute host path. Neither a guest-created link nor a concurrent rename
can therefore redirect an operation outside the export. On Windows, the guest
can only create WSL-style links, which are never followed, and HostFs rejects
any ancestor that is a symbolic link or reparse point before each operation.

Denied paths are enforced in the server namespace rather than by guest mount
layout. Lookup and mutation operations reject denied prefixes, directory
enumeration omits their names, and denied root object identities reject
hard-link, junction, and bind-mount aliases. A guest-created link cannot reach
a denied path because the guest resolves it and every resulting host lookup
applies the same policy. Mounting the same virtio-fs tag at another guest path
does not change the policy.

```admonish warning
On Windows, the check for host-created NT symbolic links and junctions in
ancestor components is not handle-relative. Do not let an untrusted host
process create reparse points or replace directories inside a Windows export
while a VM runs. On every host, quiesce external namespace mutation during
capture and restore.
```

Host filesystem behavior differs where Windows cannot represent a POSIX
operation. Unsupported operations return a Linux error rather than reporting
false success.
